## What You Need to Do Next

### Step 1: Run the Test Suite

Open Command Prompt in Windows and execute:

```cmd
cd C:\Users\kgend\Projects\md_skill_md
tests\run-tests.bat
```

**Expected Duration:** 1-2 minutes

**Expected Output:** Results showing pass/fail for all 11 test files

### Step 2: Review Results

Check the generated results file:

```text
tests\validation\results\test-run-[TIMESTAMP].txt
```

**Look for:**

- Overall success rate
- Individual test results
- Any unexpected failures
- Violation details

### Step 3: Document Results in PHASE_3_EXECUTION.md

Update the test execution log with:

- Date and time of test run
- markdownlint version
- Pass/fail counts
- Any issues found
- Action items (if needed)

### Step 4: Compare Against Predictions

Open `PHASE_3_PRE_TEST_ANALYSIS.md` and compare:

- Predicted outcomes vs actual outcomes
- Expected violations vs actual violations
- Confidence levels vs accuracy

### Step 5: Take Action Based on Results

**If 100% Success (All Tests Pass):**

1. Document success in PHASE_3_EXECUTION.md
2. Create PHASE_3_COMPLETE.md summary
3. Update version history
4. Proceed to Phase 4: Documentation

**If Some Tests Fail:**

1. Analyze which tests failed
2. Determine root cause
3. Fix issues (files or SKILL.md)
4. Update version numbers
5. Re-run tests
6. Repeat until 100% success

## Quick Reference

### Test Success Criteria

**Flawed Documents (6 files):**

- ‚úÖ Each should show violations
- ‚úÖ markdownlint should return non-zero exit code
- ‚ùå Any clean pass = test failure

**Perfect Documents (5 files):**

- ‚úÖ Each should pass cleanly
- ‚úÖ markdownlint should return zero exit code
- ‚ùå Any violations = test failure

### Expected Results

Based on pre-test analysis:

- **Prediction:** 11/11 tests pass (100% success)
- **Confidence:** 95%+
- **Issues Expected:** Minimal to none

1. `PHASE_3_TEST_GUIDE.md` - How to run tests
2. `PHASE_3_PRE_TEST_ANALYSIS.md` - Expected outcomes
3. `tests/validation/TEST-PLAN.md` - Detailed test specs

### Documents to Update

1. `PHASE_3_EXECUTION.md` - Record your results here
2. `SKILL.md` - Update if issues found (increment version)
