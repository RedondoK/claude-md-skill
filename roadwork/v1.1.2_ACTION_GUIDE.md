# v1.1.2 Quick Action Guide

**Estimated Time:** 1-2 hours
**Priority:** HIGH (fix document inconsistencies)
**Impact:** Professional consistency - skill practices what it preaches

## Task 1: Find Line Length Violations (15 min)

### Command to Find Long Lines

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd ~/Projects/md_skill_md

# Find lines longer than 80 characters (excluding code blocks and URLs)
grep -n '.\{81,\}' SKILL.md | grep -v '```' | grep -v 'http' | grep -v '|'

# Save to a file for reference
grep -n '.\{81,\}' SKILL.md | grep -v '```' | grep -v 'http' | grep -v '|' > long_lines.txt
```

### Manual Review

Check each line in context - some may be acceptable:

- Code blocks (usually excluded by config)
- URLs (cannot be shortened)
- Tables (sometimes necessary)
- Examples showing violations

**Expected Result:** List of prose lines that should be fixed

## Task 2: Fix Line Length Violations (30 min)

### Breaking Strategy

**For prose paragraphs:**

```markdown
Wrong (106 chars):
This document demonstrates correct code block formatting with proper blank lines and language identifiers.

Right (split at 79 chars):
This document demonstrates correct code block formatting with proper blank
lines and language identifiers.
```

**For list items:**

```markdown
Wrong (95 chars):
- This is a very long list item that exceeds the recommended 80 character limit and should be broken

Right (split within item):
- This is a very long list item that exceeds the recommended 80 character
  limit and should be broken
```

**For headings (if any are too long):**

```markdown
Wrong:
### This Is An Extremely Long Heading That Really Should Be Shortened For Better Readability

Right:
### This Is A Shorter Heading

Or split into heading + subheading:
### Main Topic

Brief explanation of the long concept here.
```

### Fix Process

1. Open SKILL.md in VS Code
2. Find each long line from the grep results
3. Break at natural points (spaces, commas, conjunctions)
4. Maintain readability and meaning
5. Keep indentation consistent

## Task 3: Add Markdownlint-Disable Comments (30 min)

### Locations to Add Comments

**Error Pattern sections** - These show intentional violations:

```markdown
### Error Pattern 1: List Without Blank Lines

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD032 -->
**Wrong:**

```markdown
Here are the items:
- Item 1
- Item 2
Let's continue.
```
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD032 -->

**Right:**

```markdown
Here are the items:

- Item 1
- Item 2

Let's continue.
```

### Pattern to Apply

**Before each "Wrong" example:**

```markdown
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD032 MD022 MD031 -->
```

**After each "Wrong" example:**

```markdown
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD032 MD022 MD031 -->
```

**Rules to disable based on violation shown:**

- MD032: Lists without blank lines
- MD022: Headings without blank lines
- MD031: Code blocks without blank lines
- MD040: Code blocks without language
- MD001: Heading level skipping
- MD013: Line length

### Quick Script

```bash
# This is a template - you'll need to manually apply it
# because each section shows different violations

# Example for lists section:
# Add before "Wrong" block:
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD032 -->

# Add after "Wrong" block:
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD032 -->
```

## Task 4: Clarify Resource References (15 min)

### Current Issue

Lines like:

```markdown
Reference files in this skill directory:
- `rules/markdownlint-rules-reference.md` - Complete rule documentation
```

### Improvement

Add context about availability:

```markdown
## Additional Resources

The following files are available in this GitHub repository:

- `rules/markdownlint-rules-reference.md` - Complete rule documentation
- `rules/top-ai-violations.md` - Common mistakes to avoid
- `examples/correct/` - Correct formatting examples
- `examples/incorrect/` - What NOT to do
- `resources/MARKDOWN_VALIDATION_TRAPS.md` - Edge cases and compatibility

**Repository:** <https://github.com/RedondoK/claude-md-skill>

**Local Path (if cloned):** `C:/Users/kgend/Projects/md_skill_md/`
```

### Add GitHub Link

Add to bottom of SKILL.md:

```markdown
## Links

- **GitHub Repository:** <https://github.com/RedondoK/claude-md-skill>
- **Latest Release:** <https://github.com/RedondoK/claude-md-skill/releases>
- **Issue Tracker:** <https://github.com/RedondoK/claude-md-skill/issues>
```

## Task 5: Update Version History (15 min)

### Files to Update

**1. SKILL.md** - Version at top:

```markdown
**Version:** 1.1.2
```

**2. SKILL.md** - Version History section:

```markdown
### v1.1.2 (2025-10-24)

- **FIX:** Corrected line length violations in skill document itself
- **FIX:** Added markdownlint-disable comments to intentional "Wrong" examples
- **ENHANCEMENT:** Clarified resource file locations and repository links
- **CONSISTENCY:** Document now fully practices what it preaches
- Impact: HIGH - Professional consistency achieved
```

**3. CHANGELOG.md** - Add new version:

```markdown
## [1.1.2] - 2025-10-24

### Fixed

- Line length violations in SKILL.md prose sections
- Missing markdownlint-disable comments around "Wrong" examples
- SKILL.md now passes markdownlint with 0 violations

### Documentation

- Added GitHub repository links to resource sections
- Clarified where referenced files are located
- Enhanced resource accessibility

### Why This Matters

This update fixes "do as I say, not as I do" inconsistencies where the skill
document itself violated some of the rules it teaches. Now the skill document
is a perfect example of markdownlint-compliant markdown.

**Impact:** HIGH - Professional consistency
**Priority:** CRITICAL - Document integrity
```

**4. README.md** - Update version:

```markdown
**Version:** 1.1.2
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-24
```

**5. Other docs** - Update version references:

- ROADMAP.md
- USAGE.md
- INTEGRATION.md
- QUICK_REFERENCE.md
- PROJECT-STRUCTURE.md

## Task 6: Validation (10 min)

### Validation Commands

```bash
# Validate SKILL.md (should be 0 violations now)
markdownlint SKILL.md

# Validate all updated files
markdownlint SKILL.md README.md CHANGELOG.md ROADMAP.md USAGE.md

# Full project validation
markdownlint *.md

# Check for non-breaking spaces (should be none)
grep -n $'\u00A0' SKILL.md || echo "Clean!"
```

### Expected Results

- ✅ SKILL.md: 0 violations
- ✅ All updated docs: 0 violations
- ✅ No nbsp characters found
- ✅ All lines ≤ 80 chars (except excluded)

## Task 7: Git Commit (10 min)

### Commit Process

```bash
# Stage changes
git add SKILL.md CHANGELOG.md README.md ROADMAP.md USAGE.md \
        INTEGRATION.md QUICK_REFERENCE.md PROJECT-STRUCTURE.md

# Check status
git status

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Can't find long lines

**Solution:** Adjust grep pattern:

```bash
# More permissive (finds lines > 80)
grep -n '.\{81,\}' SKILL.md

# Show line length
awk '{print NR, length, $0}' SKILL.md | awk '$2 > 80'
```

### Issue: Not sure how to break lines

**Solution:** Break at natural points:

- After commas
- After conjunctions (and, or, but)
- After prepositions (with, from, for)
- Before parentheses
- Keep related phrases together

### Issue: Markdownlint still shows violations

**Solution:** Check:

- Comments are on separate lines
- Correct rule numbers in disable/enable
- Enable comment is present (not just disable)
- Rules match the actual violation shown

### Issue: Git conflicts after updating

**Solution:**

```bash
# Stash current work
git stash

# Pull latest
git pull origin main

# Apply stash
git stash pop

# Resolve conflicts
# Then commit
```

## Next Steps After v1.1.2

1. **Validate in production** - Use skill for real markdown projects
2. **Gather feedback** - Note any issues or improvements
3. **Plan v1.2.0** - Prioritize content enhancements:
   - Comprehensive table guide
   - Enhanced cheat sheet
   - Platform compatibility table
   - Glossary
4. **Track usage** - Document real-world edge cases
5. **Schedule v1.2.0 work** - Allocate 1-2 weeks for enhancements
