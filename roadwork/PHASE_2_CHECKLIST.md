## Documentation

- [x] `tests/validation/TEST-PLAN.md` - Comprehensive test plan
- [x] `tests/README.md` - Test suite documentation
- [x] `tests/QUICK-REFERENCE.md` - Quick command reference
- [x] `tests/validation/results/README.md` - Results directory documentation
- [x] `PHASE_2_COMPLETE.md` - Phase completion summary

## Automation

- [x] `tests/run-tests.bat` - Windows test runner script
- [x] `tests/run-tests.sh` - Unix/Linux/Mac test runner script

## Directory Structure

- [x] `tests/flawed/` - Created and populated
- [x] `tests/perfect/` - Created and populated
- [x] `tests/validation/` - Created and populated
- [x] `tests/validation/results/` - Created with README

## Configuration

- [x] `.gitignore` - Configured to exclude test results

## Project Files Updated

- [x] `README.md` - Updated to reflect Phase 2 completion
- [x] Version bumped to 1.0.1

## Verification Steps

### Manual Verification

- [x] All flawed files contain intentional violations
- [x] All perfect files are correctly formatted
- [x] Test scripts are executable
- [x] Documentation is complete and accurate
- [x] Directory structure is organized

### Functional Verification

Run these commands to verify setup:

**Check file count:**

```bash
# Should show 6 files
ls tests/flawed/*.md | wc -l

# Should show 5 files
ls tests/perfect/*.md | wc -l
```

**Test individual flawed file:**

```bash
markdownlint tests/flawed/md032-lists-without-blanks.md
# Should show violations
```

**Test individual perfect file:**

```bash
markdownlint tests/perfect/perfect-lists.md
# Should be clean (no output)
```

**Run full test suite:**

```bash
# Windows
tests\run-tests.bat

# Unix/Linux/Mac
bash tests/run-tests.sh
```

## Deliverables Summary

### Files Created: 18

**Test Documents:** 11 files

- 6 flawed
- 5 perfect

**Documentation:** 5 files

- Test plan
- Test suite README
- Quick reference
- Results README
- Phase completion summary

**Scripts:** 2 files

- Windows batch script
- Unix bash script

### Directories Created: 3

- `tests/flawed/`
- `tests/perfect/`
- `tests/validation/results/`

## Quality Checks

- [x] All files use GFM formatting
- [x] All documentation follows SKILL.md guidelines
- [x] All files have proper blank lines
- [x] All code blocks have language identifiers
- [x] All lists have consistent markers
- [x] All headings have proper spacing

## Phase 2 Status

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

All objectives met:

- Intentionally flawed test documents created
- Perfect reference documents created
- Validation test cases built
- Expected vs actual results documented
- Automated test execution scripts created
- Comprehensive documentation written

## Next Steps

Ready to proceed to **Phase 3: Skill Testing & Iteration**

Phase 3 will:

1. Use skill to generate test documents
2. Run documents through validation
3. Compare against test suite
4. Identify failure patterns
5. Iterate skill improvements

## Sign-Off

**Phase:** 2 - Test Suite Creation  
**Date Completed:** 2025-10-22  
**Version:** 1.0.1  
**Status:** ✅ READY FOR PHASE 3
