# Phase 3: Skill Testing & Iteration

**Date Started:** 2025-10-22  
**Status:** In Progress  
**Version:** 1.0.0

## Overview

Phase 3 validates the GFM Skill against the test suite created in Phase 2. This phase includes:

1. Running automated tests against all test documents
2. Analyzing results for patterns
3. Identifying skill improvement opportunities
4. Iterating on the skill
5. Documenting findings

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Pre-Test Verification

**Checklist:**

- [ ] markdownlint-cli is installed and accessible
- [ ] All test files are present (6 flawed, 5 perfect)
- [ ] Test scripts are executable
- [ ] Results directory exists
- [ ] SKILL.md is current version (1.0.1)

### Step 2: Run Initial Test Suite

**Command:**

```cmd
cd C:\Users\kgend\Projects\md_skill_md
tests\run-tests.bat
```

**Expected Results:**

- All flawed documents should trigger violations
- All perfect documents should pass cleanly
- Results file should be generated with timestamp

### Step 3: Analyze Test Results

**Analysis Areas:**

1. **Violation Detection Accuracy**
   - Are expected violations detected?
   - Are violation line numbers accurate?
   - Are there any false negatives?

2. **Perfect Document Validation**
   - Do perfect documents pass cleanly?
   - Are there any false positives?
   - Does the skill produce valid output?

3. **Pattern Identification**
   - What patterns consistently pass?
   - What patterns consistently fail?
   - Are there edge cases?

### Step 4: Document Findings

**For Each Test Category:**

- Test name
- Expected outcome
- Actual outcome
- Pass/fail status
- Notes on discrepancies
- Improvement opportunities

### Step 5: Skill Improvements

**If Issues Found:**

1. Identify root cause
2. Update SKILL.md with clarifications
3. Add examples if needed
4. Update version number
5. Re-run tests
6. Document changes

### Step 6: Iteration

Repeat Steps 2-5 until:

- All tests pass as expected
- No false positives or negatives
- Skill documentation is comprehensive
- All edge cases are covered

## Validation Criteria

### Test Suite Must Pass

- [ ] All flawed documents trigger expected violations
- [ ] All perfect documents pass cleanly
- [ ] No false positives detected
- [ ] No false negatives detected
- [ ] Violation line numbers are accurate

### Skill Documentation Must Be

- [ ] Complete and comprehensive
- [ ] Clear and unambiguous
- [ ] Accurate in all examples
- [ ] Free of violations itself
- [ ] Easy to follow for AI agents

### Edge Cases Must Be Covered

- [ ] Nested structures

## Success Metrics

**Phase 3 Complete When:**

- All automated tests pass (100% success rate)
- Skill documentation is validated
- All known edge cases are covered
- No outstanding issues remain
- Documentation is complete

## Next Steps After Phase 3

Upon successful completion:

1. Mark Phase 3 complete
2. Create PHASE_3_COMPLETE.md summary
3. Update version history
4. Proceed to Phase 4: Documentation (parallel track)
5. Begin Phase 5: Quality Assurance
