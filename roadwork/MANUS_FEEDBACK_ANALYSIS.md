> methods for debugging."

**Validation:** Commands are useful and well-documented

## Manus Improvement Recommendations

### HIGH PRIORITY

#### 1. Context Window Limitations ⚠️ CRITICAL

**Issue:**

> "The document's length is its most significant liability. If an AI's context
> window is smaller than the document, it may not be able to consider all the
> rules simultaneously."

**Impact:** HIGH - Could prevent AI from using skill effectively

**Current State:**

- SKILL.md: ~900 lines
- ~30,000+ tokens estimated
- May exceed some AI context limits

**Solution:** Create concise versions

**Action Items:**

1. Create `SKILL_CORE.md` (200-300 lines, essential rules only)
2. Create `SKILL_QUICK.md` (50-100 lines, golden rules only)
3. Keep full SKILL.md for reference
4. Add routing guidance (which version to use when)

**Priority:** 1 (Most critical issue identified)

#### 2. Prioritization - Golden Rules Section

**Recommendation:**

> "Create a high-priority 'Core Rules' or 'Golden Rules' section at the very
> top."

**Rationale:** Ensures most critical rules are always prioritized

**Proposed Golden Rules (Top 5):**

1. **Blank lines are mandatory** (around lists, headings, code blocks)
2. **Use regular spaces only** (never nbsp or tabs)
3. **Specify language for code blocks** (always include identifier)
4. **Increment heading levels by one** (no skipping)
5. **One list marker style** (use `-` consistently)

**Implementation:**

```markdown
# GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) Skill

## Golden Rules (ALWAYS Follow These)

1. **Blank Lines:** Mandatory before/after lists, headings, code blocks
2. **Spacing:** Regular spaces (U+0020) only, never nbsp/tabs
3. **Code Languages:** Always specify (```python, ```bash, etc.)
4. **Heading Levels:** Increment by one (1→2→3, never 1→3)
5. **List Markers:** Use `-` consistently throughout

These 5 rules prevent 90% of all markdownlint violations.

(rest of document follows)
```

**Priority:** 2 (High impact, easy to implement)

#### 3. Conciseness and Redundancy

**Recommendation:**

> "Consolidate the 'Critical Error Prevention' section with the main
> 'Generation Rules.'"

**Current Structure:**

- Generation Rules (detailed)
- Critical Error Prevention (repeats same rules with examples)
- Redundancy: ~200 lines of repeated content

**Proposed Structure:**

```markdown
### Rule 1: Lists (MD032, MD004)

**Requirements:**
- Blank line before list
- Blank line after list
- Consistent markers

**Right:**
(example)

**Wrong:**
(example)
```

**Benefit:** Reduces document by ~200 lines while maintaining clarity

**Priority:** 3 (Helps with context window issue)

### MEDIUM PRIORITY

#### 4. Structural Clarity - Table Format

**Recommendation:**

> "Consider converting the primary rules into a more structured format, such as
> a table."

**Example:**

| Rule ID | Description | Right | Wrong |
|---------|-------------|-------|-------|
| MD032 | Lists need blank lines | `text\n\n- item\n\ntext` | `text\n- item\ntext` |
| MD022 | Headings need blank lines | `text\n\n## Head\n\ntext` | `text\n## Head\ntext` |

**Pros:**

- Machine-readable
- Easy to scan
- Compact format

**Cons:**

- Less detailed than prose
- May be harder to read for humans
- Tables are error-prone in markdown

**Decision:** Create table version as supplement, keep prose as primary

**Priority:** 5 (Nice to have)

#### 5. Language and Tone

**Recommendation:**

> "Rephrase instructions to be more direct and less anthropomorphic. Replace
> 'mentally review' with 'Verify the following constraints.'"

**Examples:**

**Before:** "Before generating ANY markdown, mentally review:"

**After:** "Before generating markdown, verify these constraints:"

**Before:** "Think of markdown as blocks with mandatory spacing"

**After:** "Markdown structure: blocks separated by blank lines"

**Priority:** 6 (Polish, low effort)

#### 6. Content Gaps - Tables and HTML

**Recommendation:**

> "Add dedicated sections for creating and validating tables and for the
> appropriate use of raw HTML."

**Current State:**

- Tables: Brief mention only
- HTML: Not covered

**Needed:**

1. **Table Section:**
   - Column alignment (`:---`, `:---:`, `---:`)
   - Escaping pipes (`&#124;`)
   - Multi-line cells
   - Complex content handling

2. **HTML Section:**
   - When HTML is appropriate
   - Inline vs block HTML
   - Closing tags requirement
   - HTML in lists

**Priority:** 4 (Grok also identified this gap)

#### 7. Modularity

**Recommendation:**

> "Move the detailed content from the 'Advanced: Edge Cases' section into the
> referenced MARKDOWN_VALIDATION_TRAPS.md file."

**Current:** Advanced section is ~200 lines in SKILL.md

**Proposed:**

- Keep 1-2 paragraph summary in SKILL.md
- Move details to MARKDOWN_VALIDATION_TRAPS.md
- Add clear reference link

**Benefit:** Reduces main document by ~150 lines

**Priority:** 7 (Helps with length, low priority)

## Manus Potential Problems

### 1. Context Window Limitations ⚠️

**Problem:**

> "If an AI's context window is smaller than the document, it may not be able
> to consider all the rules simultaneously."

**Real-World Impact:**

- Claude 3 Haiku: 200K tokens (should be fine)
- Claude 3 Sonnet: 200K tokens (should be fine)
- GPT-4: 128K tokens (should be fine)
- GPT-3.5: 16K tokens (might struggle)
- Some smaller models: 4K-8K tokens (will fail)

**Solution:** Create tiered versions

**Versions:**

1. **SKILL_GOLDEN.md** (50-100 lines) - Essential rules only
2. **SKILL_CORE.md** (200-300 lines) - Core rules + examples
3. **SKILL.md** (900 lines) - Complete reference

**Usage Guidance:**

- Use SKILL_GOLDEN.md for quick generation
- Use SKILL_CORE.md for most tasks
- Use SKILL.md for complex documents or reference

### 2. Subjectivity in Rules

**Problem:**

> "Some rules are open to interpretation. For example, 'Keep lines under 80
> characters when possible' and break at 'natural points' is subjective."

**Examples of Subjective Guidance:**

- "Natural points" for line breaks
- "When possible" for 80 character limit
- "Reasonable" heading hierarchy

**Solution:** Add prescriptive guidance

**Before:** "Break long paragraphs at natural points"

**After:** "Break lines after punctuation, before conjunctions (and, or, but),
or after prepositions (with, for, from)"

**Before:** "Keep lines under 80 characters when possible"

**After:** "Keep lines under 80 characters. Exceptions: code blocks, URLs,
tables, HTML tags"

### 3. Over-Correction and Awkward Prose

**Problem:**

> "An AI might apply the rules too rigidly, particularly the line-length rule,
> resulting in prose that is grammatically correct but stylistically awkward."

**Example:**

**Too rigid:**

```markdown
This is
a sentence
that was
broken at
80 characters
but is
very awkward
to read.
```

**Better:**

```markdown
This is a sentence that was broken at 80 characters at natural boundaries,
making it much easier to read.
```

**Solution:** Add readability principle

**New Rule:**

> "Readability > Strict Compliance: If breaking a line at 80 characters creates
> awkward phrasing, prefer readability. Break at sentence boundaries when
> possible."

### 4. Tool and Platform Dependency

**Problem:**

> "The document is tightly coupled to markdownlint and GFM."

**Current State:** Acknowledged in document but noted as operational
consideration

**Assessment:** This is acceptable given the stated purpose

**No action needed** - Document is clear about its target (GFM + markdownlint)

## Key Insight from Manus

### The Context Window Problem

**This is the most important finding across all three evaluations.**

Manus identified that document length isn't just about human readability—it's
about **whether AI can even use the skill effectively**.

**Problem:**

- SKILL.md: ~900 lines, ~30K tokens
- Some AI models: 4K-16K context window
- Result: Can't load full skill

**Solution:**

Create tiered versions so skill works for ALL AI models:

- Small models (4K-16K): Use SKILL_GOLDEN.md
- Medium models (16K-100K): Use SKILL_CORE.md
- Large models (100K+): Use SKILL.md

**This single change makes the skill universally usable.**

## Conclusion

### Ranking the Feedback

1. **Manus** - Strategic, identifies root cause (context window), provides
   architectural solutions
2. **Grok** - Tactical, identifies actual violations, provides specific fixes
3. **Gemini** - Validation, confirms quality, provides confidence

### What to Do Next

**Immediate (This week):**

1. Create SKILL_GOLDEN.md (50-100 lines)
2. Add Golden Rules section to SKILL.md
3. Start SKILL_CORE.md (200-300 lines)

**Short-term (This month):**

4. Complete SKILL_CORE.md
5. Add table section
6. Add HTML section
7. Consolidate redundancy

**Medium-term (Next month):**

8. Reduce subjectivity in rules
