# v1.1.2 Fix Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-24  
**Issues Addressed:** MD032, MD031, MD040, MD036, MD022, MD023, MD025, MD026  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Rule 8 "NEVER" Example (Lines 397-413)

**Problem:** Code block inside list was using:

- 3 spaces indentation (should be 4)
- `#` comment character (interpreted as heading by markdownlint)
- Missing disable comments

**Solution:**

```markdown
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD032 MD031 MD040 -->

**NEVER:**

```markdown
- List item with nested code:

   ```
   // If these spaces are nbsp, the block won't nest properly!
   code_here()
   ```

- Next item will start a new list instead of continuing
```

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD032 MD031 MD040 -->
```

**Changes:**

- ✅ Added markdownlint-disable comments
- ✅ Changed `#` to `//` (prevents heading interpretation)
- ✅ Removed language identifier (showing wrong pattern)

### 2. Error Pattern 7 (Lines 544-574)

**Problem:**

- Wrong example used 3 spaces with nbsp
- Right example also used 3 spaces (should be 4)
- Missing disable comments

**Solution:**

**Wrong example (with disable comments):**

```markdown
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD032 MD031 MD040 -->

**Wrong (using non-breaking space for indentation):**

```markdown
- List item

   ```
   code()
   ```

- Next item (will be renumbered as item 1!)
```

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD032 MD031 MD040 -->
```

**Right example (4 spaces):**

```markdown
**Right (using regular spaces):**

```markdown
- List item

    ```python
    code()
    ```

- Next item (continues properly)
```
```

**Changes:**

- ✅ Added disable comments to wrong example
- ✅ Changed right example to use 4 spaces (not 3)
- ✅ Added language identifier to right example

### 3. Block Transition Rule (Line 704)

**Problem:** Used emphasis instead of heading

**Before:**

```markdown
**Every block transition = blank line required**
```

**After:**

```markdown
### Block Transition Rule

Every block transition = blank line required
```

**Changes:**

- ✅ Changed from bold text to proper heading
- ✅ Split into heading + content

## Key Learnings

### 1. Nested Code Blocks Need 4 Spaces

**Not 3 spaces!**

```markdown
- List item

    ```python  ← Four spaces here!
    code()
    ```

- Next item (continues in same list)
```

**Why:** Markdown requires 4 spaces to indent content within list items.

### 2. Comment Characters Matter in Examples

**Problem:** Using `#` inside code blocks without language identifier:

```markdown
   ```
   # This is interpreted as a heading!
   ```
```

**Solution:** Use different comment characters in wrong examples:

```markdown
   ```
   // This is safe, won't be interpreted as heading
   ```
```

### 3. Disable Comments Are Essential

**For intentional wrong examples:**

```markdown
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD032 MD031 MD040 -->

**Wrong:**
(intentionally broken example here)

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD032 MD031 MD040 -->
```

This tells markdownlint to ignore violations in demonstration code.

### 4. Structural Elements Need Proper Headings

**Bad:** `**Every block transition = blank line required**`

**Good:**

```markdown
### Block Transition Rule

Every block transition = blank line required
```

## Validation Commands

Run these to verify the fixes:

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd ~/Projects/md_skill_md

# Validate SKILL.md (should be 0 violations!)
markdownlint SKILL.md

# Expected output: Nothing (silence = success)

# Check for nbsp characters
grep -n $'\u00A0' SKILL.md || echo "✅ No nbsp found!"

# Full validation
markdownlint *.md
```

## Expected Results

**SKILL.md:** 0 violations ✅

All errors should be resolved:

- ✅ MD032 (blanks-around-lists) - Fixed with disable comments
- ✅ MD031 (blanks-around-fences) - Fixed with disable comments
- ✅ MD040 (fenced-code-language) - Removed from wrong examples
- ✅ MD036 (no-emphasis-as-heading) - Changed to proper heading
- ✅ MD022 (blanks-around-headings) - Fixed by changing `#` to `//`
- ✅ MD023 (heading-start-left) - Fixed by changing `#` to `//`
- ✅ MD025 (single-title) - Fixed by changing `#` to `//`
- ✅ MD026 (no-trailing-punctuation) - Fixed by changing `#` to `//`

## Git Commit Commands

If validation passes:

```bash
# Stage the changes
git add SKILL.md v1.1.2_FIX_SUMMARY.md

# Commit with detailed message
git commit -m "fix: Correct nested code block examples and add disable comments

- Fixed nested code blocks to use 4 spaces (not 3) for proper list context
- Changed comment character from # to // in wrong examples (prevents heading interpretation)
- Added markdownlint-disable comments around all intentional wrong examples
- Changed Block Transition Rule from emphasis to proper heading
- Removed language identifiers from wrong examples (part of the mistake being shown)

Fixes: MD032, MD031, MD040, MD036, MD022, MD023, MD025, MD026
Issue: Examples with # comments were interpreted as headings
Result: SKILL.md now passes markdownlint with 0 violations

This completes v1.1.2 - document now fully practices what it preaches."

# Push to remote
git push origin main
