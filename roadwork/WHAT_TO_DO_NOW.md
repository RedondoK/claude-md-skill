# What to Do Now - Decision Guide

**Date:** 2025-10-24  
**Current Status:** v1.1.2 fixes ready to commit  
**Next Decision:** Commit now or plan v1.2.0 first?

## Current Situation

You have received feedback from **three different AI systems**:

- ‚úÖ **Gemini:** "Perfect, no changes needed"
- ‚úÖ **Grok:** "9/10, here are 24 improvements"
- ‚úÖ **Manus:** "Exceptionally thorough, but 6 strategic improvements needed"

**AND** you've just fixed all the v1.1.2 issues (nested code blocks, disable
comments).

## The Big Question

**Should you commit v1.1.2 now, or plan v1.2.0 first?**

## Your Three Options

### Option A: Commit v1.1.2 Now ‚úÖ (Recommended)

**What:**

- Commit the fixes we just made
- Close out v1.1.2
- Plan v1.2.0 next

**When:** Tonight (30 minutes)

**Why:**

- v1.1.2 fixes are complete and tested
- Document now practices what it preaches
- Clean slate for v1.2.0 planning

**Commands:**

```bash
cd ~/Projects/md_skill_md

# Validate
markdownlint SKILL.md

# Stage
git add SKILL.md v1.1.2_FIX_SUMMARY.md

# Commit
git commit -m "fix: Correct nested code examples and disable comments

- Fixed nested code blocks to use 4 spaces for list context
- Changed comment character from # to // in wrong examples
- Added markdownlint-disable comments around intentional violations
- Changed Block Transition Rule from emphasis to proper heading

Fixes: MD032, MD031, MD040, MD036, MD022, MD023, MD025, MD026
Result: SKILL.md passes markdownlint with 0 violations"

# Push
git push origin main
```

**Then:** Read feedback analysis docs and plan v1.2.0 over the weekend

**Benefit:** Clean commit history, organized planning

### Option B: Plan v1.2.0 Now

**What:**

- Skip v1.1.2 commit for now
- Dive into v1.2.0 planning immediately
- Commit v1.1.2 changes as part of v1.2.0

**When:** This weekend (plan), next 2-4 weeks (execute)

**Why:**

- You're excited about Manus recommendations
- Want to see the big picture first
- Prefer to plan comprehensively

**Risk:** Current fixes sit uncommitted longer

**Benefit:** Comprehensive vision before committing

### Option C: Hybrid Approach

**What:**

- Quick commit of v1.1.2 tonight (15 minutes)
- Start v1.2.0 planning this weekend
- Execute v1.2.0 over next 2-4 weeks

**When:** Tonight (commit) + Weekend (plan) + Month (execute)

**Why:**

- Gets v1.1.2 off your plate
- Gives you clean planning space
- Best of both worlds

**Benefit:** Organized and efficient

## My Strong Recommendation: Option A (or C)

**Commit v1.1.2 tonight.** Here's why:

1. **Fixes are done** - No reason to leave them uncommitted
2. **Clean history** - Each version has clear purpose
3. **Mental closure** - You can focus on v1.2.0 planning
4. **Professional practice** - Commit working code promptly
5. **No risk** - v1.2.0 changes are separate concerns

## After Committing v1.1.2

### This Weekend: Planning

**Read these three documents carefully:**

1. **MANUS_FEEDBACK_ANALYSIS.md** - Most important, read first
2. **GROK_FEEDBACK_ANALYSIS.md** - Good tactical details
3. **AI_FEEDBACK_COMPARISON.md** - Quick comparison

**Decide on v1.2.0 priorities:**

- [ ] Will you create SKILL_GOLDEN.md? (Manus #1 recommendation)
- [ ] Will you create SKILL_CORE.md? (Manus context window solution)
- [ ] Will you add Golden Rules section? (Manus #2 recommendation)
- [ ] Will you add comprehensive table guide? (Both Grok and Manus)
- [ ] Will you add HTML section? (Manus content gap)
- [ ] Will you consolidate redundancy? (Manus #3 recommendation)

**Create v1.2.0 roadmap:**

- Week 1 tasks
- Week 2 tasks
- Week 3-4 tasks (if needed)
- Success criteria

### Next 2-4 Weeks: Execution

**Week 1 (Highest Priority):**

- Create SKILL_GOLDEN.md (50-100 lines)
- Add Golden Rules section to SKILL.md

**Week 2 (High Priority):**

- Create SKILL_CORE.md (200-300 lines)
- Start table guide section

**Week 3 (Medium Priority):**

- Complete table guide
- Add HTML section

**Week 4 (Polish):**

- Consolidate redundancy
- Test all versions
- Update documentation

## The Most Important Thing Manus Said

### Context Window Is The Biggest Issue

> "The document's length is its most significant liability."

**Translation:**

- Your skill is ~900 lines (~30K tokens)
- Some AI models have 4K-16K context windows
- **They can't even load your skill!**

**Solution:**

Create three versions:

1. **SKILL_GOLDEN.md** - 50-100 lines (works everywhere)
2. **SKILL_CORE.md** - 200-300 lines (works for 90% of cases)
3. **SKILL.md** - 900 lines (complete reference)

**This makes your skill universally usable.**
