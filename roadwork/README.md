# Roadwork Directory

This directory contains development artifacts, working files, and process
documentation that supported the creation of the GitHub Flavored Markdown skill.

## Purpose

The `roadwork/` directory stores:

- Phase documentation from the development process
- AI feedback analysis and comparisons
- Fix guides and summaries
- Status reports and action plans
- Working scripts used during development
- Historical development artifacts

## Contents

### Phase Documentation

Development was organized into phases, each documented here:

- **Phase 0:** Research and requirements gathering
- **Phase 2:** Test suite creation
- **Phase 3:** Skill testing and iteration
- **Phase 4:** Documentation completion
- **Phase 5:** Quality assurance and validation
- **Phase 6:** Final polish and organization

### AI Feedback Analysis

Comparative analysis of different AI systems' markdown generation:

- Gemini feedback analysis
- Grok feedback analysis  
- Manus feedback analysis
- Cross-AI comparison

### Fix Documentation

Guides and summaries for addressing specific issues:

- Markdownlint fix guides
- NBSP enhancement documentation
- Violation fix summaries
- Quick fix commands

### Working Scripts

Shell scripts used during development:

- Error fixing automation
- Quick violation fixes
- Testing and validation helpers
- Organization utilities

### Status and Planning

Progress tracking and action planning:

- Status reports
- Next steps documentation
- Action guides
- "What to do now" summaries

## Not Deliverables

**Important:** Files in this directory are NOT part of the skill deliverables.
They document the development process but are not needed for using the skill.

### Deliverable Files (Not Here)

The actual skill deliverables remain in the repository root:

- `SKILL.md` - Main skill document
- `README.md` - Project overview
- `USAGE.md` - Usage guide
- `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` - Quick reference card
- `INTEGRATION.md` - Integration guide
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Contribution guidelines
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Version history
- Plus directories: `examples/`, `tests/`, `rules/`, etc.

## Why Keep This?

This directory is retained for:

1. **Historical Reference:** Understanding how the skill evolved
2. **Process Documentation:** Learning from the development approach
3. **Lessons Learned:** Insights for future improvements
4. **Transparency:** Showing the work behind the skill
5. **Reproducibility:** Documenting the development methodology

## Navigating This Directory

### By Phase

Look for `PHASE_N_*.md` files for chronological development:

```bash
ls -1 PHASE_*.md | sort
```

### By Topic

- **Analysis:** `*_ANALYSIS.md` files
- **Fixes:** `*_FIX_*.md` files
- **Status:** `STATUS_*.md` files
- **Plans:** `*_PLAN.md`, `*_GUIDE.md` files

### By File Type

```bash
# All markdown documentation
ls -1 *.md

# All shell scripts
ls -1 *.sh

# Phase 6 working directory
ls -la phase6/
```

## Ignore in Production

When using the skill in production:

- **Don't** reference files in `roadwork/`
- **Don't** include `roadwork/` in deployments
- **Don't** link to `roadwork/` content from deliverables
- **Do** focus on the root-level skill files

## Cleanup Note

If you're cloning this repository for production use, you can safely delete the
`roadwork/` directory. It's not needed for the skill to function.

```bash
# Optional: Remove roadwork directory
rm -rf roadwork/
```

## Archive vs Roadwork

**archive/:** Completed versions and releases
**roadwork/:** Development process and working files

Both are historical, but `archive/` contains actual skill versions while
`roadwork/` contains the development process.

---

**Summary:** This directory is the "workshop" where the skill was built. The
finished product is in the repository root. Keep this for reference, but focus
on the deliverables for actual usage.
