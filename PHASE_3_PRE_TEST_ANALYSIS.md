**Analyst:** Claude (AI Assistant)

## Overview

This document provides a detailed analysis of each test file to predict expected violations and outcomes. This serves as a reference for comparing actual test results.

## Flawed Document Analysis

### File 1: md001-heading-increment.md

**Purpose:** Test heading level progression violations

**Expected Violations:**

Line 5: `### Skipped to Level 3` - skips from H1 to H3 (MD001)

Line 11: `#### Skipped to Level 4` - skips from H2 to H4 (MD001)

Line 17: `##### Skipped Multiple Levels` - skips from H2 to H5 (MD001)

**Total Expected:** 3 MD001 violations

**Confidence:** High - violations are clear and unambiguous

### File 2: md004-inconsistent-list-markers.md

**Purpose:** Test inconsistent list marker violations

**Expected Violations:**

Multiple lines using mixed markers (`-`, `*`, `+`)

Specific violations depend on markdownlint's detection algorithm

**Total Expected:** 5+ MD004 violations

**Confidence:** High - file deliberately mixes all three marker types

### File 3: md022-headings-without-blanks.md

**Purpose:** Test blank lines around headings

**Expected Violations:**

Multiple headings without proper blank line spacing above or below

**Total Expected:** 5+ MD022 violations

**Confidence:** High - this is one of the most common violations

### File 4: md031-md040-code-blocks.md

**Purpose:** Test code block formatting issues

**Expected Violations:**

MD031: Code blocks without surrounding blank lines

MD040: Code blocks without language identifiers

**Total Expected:** 6+ violations (combination of MD031 and MD040)

**Confidence:** High - both violation types should be detected

### File 5: md032-lists-without-blanks.md

**Purpose:** Test blank lines around lists

**Analysis of actual file content:**

```markdown
Line 5-8: List without blank line before
- Item 1
- Item 2  
- Item 3
Line 9: No blank line after list

Line 13-16: List without blank lines
* First point  (also MD004 - uses * instead of -)
* Second point
* Third point
Line 17: No blank line after

Line 21-24: Nested list without blanks
- Parent item
  - Child 1
  - Child 2
- Another parent
Line 25: No blank line after

Line 29-32: Ordered list without blanks
1. Step one
2. Step two
3. Step three
Line 33: No blank line after
```

**Expected Violations:**

- Line 5: MD032 (no blank before list)
- Line 9: MD032 (no blank after list)
- Line 13: MD032 (no blank before list) + MD004 (wrong marker)
- Line 17: MD032 (no blank after list)
- Line 21: MD032 (no blank before list)
- Line 25: MD032 (no blank after list)
- Line 29: MD032 (no blank before list)
- Line 33: MD032 (no blank after list)

**Total Expected:** ~8 MD032 violations + 3 MD004 violations

**Confidence:** Very High - file was specifically designed for this

### File 6: multiple-violations.md

**Purpose:** Comprehensive test with multiple violation types

**Expected Violations:**

- MD022: Heading without blank line
- MD032: Lists without blank lines
- MD031: Code blocks without blank lines
- MD040: Code block without language
- MD004: Mixed list markers
- MD001: Heading level skips

## Predicted Test Results Summary

### Flawed Documents (Should ALL Detect Violations)

| File | Expected Violations | Confidence | Should Pass Test? |
|------|-------------------|------------|-------------------|
| md001-heading-increment.md | 3 (MD001) | High | ✅ Yes |
| md004-inconsistent-list-markers.md | 5+ (MD004) | High | ✅ Yes |
| md022-headings-without-blanks.md | 5+ (MD022) | High | ✅ Yes |
| md031-md040-code-blocks.md | 6+ (MD031, MD040) | High | ✅ Yes |
| md032-lists-without-blanks.md | 8+ (MD032) + 3 (MD004) | Very High | ✅ Yes |
| multiple-violations.md | 10+ (various) | High | ✅ Yes |

**Overall Prediction:** 6/6 flawed tests should pass (violations detected)

### Perfect Documents (Should ALL Pass Clean)

| File | Expected Result | Confidence | Should Pass Test? |
|------|----------------|------------|-------------------|
| perfect-code-blocks.md | Clean | Very High | ✅ Yes |
| perfect-comprehensive.md | Clean | Very High | ✅ Yes |
| perfect-heading-increment.md | Clean | Very High | ✅ Yes |
| perfect-headings.md | Clean | High | ✅ Yes |
| perfect-lists.md | Clean | Very High | ✅ Yes |

**Overall Prediction:** 5/5 perfect tests should pass (no violations)

## Overall Test Suite Prediction

**Predicted Success Rate:** 100% (11/11 tests pass)

**Reasoning:**

1. **Flawed documents are clearly flawed**
   - Violations are unambiguous
   - Multiple instances of each violation type
   - Should be easily detected by markdownlint

2. **Perfect documents are correctly formatted**
   - Careful analysis shows compliance with all rules
   - Blank lines are properly placed
   - All structural elements are correct

3. **SKILL.md guidance is accurate**
   - Test files align with SKILL.md rules
   - Examples match the guidance
   - No contradictions identified

## Potential Issues to Watch

### Issue 1: MD004 Detection Algorithm

**Concern:** markdownlint might count MD004 violations differently than expected.

**Impact:** Minor - counts might vary but violations should still be detected.

**Mitigation:** Accept any non-zero count as success for flawed tests.

### Issue 2: Line Number Precision

**Concern:** Line numbers in violation reports might not match predictions exactly.

**Impact:** Minor - doesn't affect pass/fail, only precision of reporting.

**Mitigation:** Verify violations exist, don't require exact line matches.

### Issue 3: Additional Violations

**Concern:** Files might trigger violations beyond those predicted.

**Impact:** None if flawed; concerning if perfect files affected.

**Mitigation:** Investigate any unexpected violations in perfect files.

## Validation Strategy

### For Flawed Documents

**Success Criteria:**

- ✅ markdownlint returns non-zero exit code
- ✅ At least one violation is reported
- ✅ Violation types match expected categories

**Does NOT Require:**

- Exact violation count match
- Exact line number match
- Identical output to predictions

### For Perfect Documents

**Success Criteria:**

- ✅ markdownlint returns zero exit code
- ✅ Zero violations reported
- ✅ No output to stdout/stderr

**Failure Indicators:**

- ❌ Any violations reported
- ❌ Non-zero exit code
- ❌ Any error messages

## Next Steps After Actual Test

1. **Compare actual results to predictions**
   - Document matches and mismatches
   - Analyze any surprises
   - Update predictions if needed

2. **If predictions are wrong**
   - Investigate root cause
   - Update SKILL.md if guidance was wrong
   - Update test files if they were wrong
   - Update this analysis

3. **If tests fail unexpectedly**
   - Check markdownlint version
   - Check for config files affecting results
   - Verify test files weren't modified
   - Check SKILL.md accuracy

## Confidence Assessment

**Overall Confidence:** Very High (95%+)

**Reasoning:**

- Test files were carefully crafted
- Analysis is thorough
- SKILL.md guidance is comprehensive
- Violations are unambiguous
- Perfect files closely follow rules

**Highest Confidence Tests:**

1. perfect-lists.md (100% confidence)
2. md032-lists-without-blanks.md (100% confidence)
3. perfect-comprehensive.md (98% confidence)

**Potential Uncertainty:**

1. md004 exact violation counts
2. Multiple-violations.md (complex interactions)
3. Line number precision

## Documentation Plan

After actual tests:

1. Create results comparison table
2. Document prediction accuracy
3. Analyze any mismatches
4. Update confidence ratings
5. Improve future predictions

## Success Metrics

**For This Analysis:**

- Predictions match actual results: 90%+ accuracy
- No major surprises in test outcomes
- All test pass/fail predictions correct

**For Overall Phase 3:**

- 100% test success rate
- No SKILL.md updates needed
- No test file corrections needed
- Ready to proceed to Phase 4

## Conclusion

Based on thorough file analysis:

- **Prediction:** All 11 tests will pass
- **Confidence:** 95%+
- **Ready for testing:** Yes
- **Expected issues:** Minimal to none

The test suite appears well-designed, and the SKILL.md guidance appears accurate. Proceeding with actual test execution is recommended.
