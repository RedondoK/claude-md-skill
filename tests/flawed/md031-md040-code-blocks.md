# Test Document: MD031 and MD040 Violations

This document intentionally violates MD031 (blanks around code) and MD040 (language identifiers).

## Section 1

Here's some code:
```
def hello():
    print("Hello")
```
Notice no blank lines and no language.

## Section 2
Another example:
```
{
  "key": "value"
}
```
More text here.

## Section 3

Sometimes we add language but forget blanks:
```python
def test():
    return True
```
Continuing text.

## Section 4
Or we have blanks but no language:

```
console.log("test");
```

Done.
