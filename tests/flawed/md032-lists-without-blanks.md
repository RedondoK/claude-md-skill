# Test Document: MD032 Violations

This document intentionally violates MD032 (blanks around lists).

## Section 1
Here are some items:
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3
Let's continue with more text.

## Section 2

Another paragraph before a list.
* First point
* Second point
* Third point
More text immediately after.

## Section 3
Sometimes we have nested issues:
- Parent item
  - Child 1
  - Child 2
- Another parent
And text continues.

## Section 4

Final example with ordered list:
1. Step one
2. Step two
3. Step three
Done with the list.
