# Perfect Code Blocks Example

This document demonstrates correct code block formatting with proper spacing.

## Section 1

Here's some code with proper spacing and language identifier:

```python
def hello():
    print("Hello")
```

Notice the blank lines and language specification.

## Section 2

Another example with JSON:

```json
{
  "key": "value"
}
```

More text here with proper spacing.

## Section 3

JavaScript example:

```javascript
console.log("test");
```

Continuing text with proper spacing.

## Section 4

Even plain text should have a language identifier:

```text
This is plain text content.
No syntax highlighting needed.
```

Done with examples.
