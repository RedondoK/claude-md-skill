# Perfect Lists Example

This document demonstrates correct list formatting with proper blank lines.

## Section 1

Here are some items with proper spacing:

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

Let's continue with more text after the list.

## Section 2

Another paragraph before a list.

- First point
- Second point
- Third point

More text properly spaced after the list.

## Section 3

Sometimes we have nested structures:

- Parent item
  - Child 1
  - Child 2
- Another parent

And text continues with proper spacing.

## Section 4

Final example with ordered list:

1. Step one
2. Step two
3. Step three

Done with the list.
