**Run these commands to complete the repository organization:**

## Step 1: Execute Organization Script

### For Git Bash (Recommended on Windows):

bash organize_files.sh
```

### For Windows Command Prompt:

```cmd
cd C:\Users\kgend\Projects\md_skill_md
organize_files.bat
```

## Step 2: Review Changes

```bash
# See what was moved
ls roadwork/

# Verify root is clean
ls *.md
```

## Step 3: Commit Everything

```bash
git add -A
git status
git commit -m "chore: reorganize repository structure

- Add .gitattributes for line ending normalization
- Add CONTRIBUTING.md with contribution guidelines
- Update README.md with repository structure
