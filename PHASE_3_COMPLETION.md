## Issues Identified and Resolved

### Issue 1: Windows Batch File Output Truncation üî¥ DOCUMENTED

**Problem:** `run-tests.bat` truncates output at exactly 10,082 bytes

**Root Cause:** Windows batch file limitation with output redirection and buffering

**Impact:** Cannot run automated full test suite on Windows

**Resolution:**

- Manual testing via Linux/WSL environment
- Shell script version (`run-tests.sh`) works correctly
- Documented limitation in test documentation

**Status:** Workaround in place, future enhancement to create PowerShell version

### Issue 2: MD013 Not Documented ‚ö†Ô∏è RESOLVED

**Problem:** perfect-code-blocks.md had 106-character line (limit: 80)

**Line:** "This document demonstrates correct code block formatting with proper blank lines and language identifiers."

**Root Cause:**

- MD013 (line-length) rule was not documented in SKILL.md
- Test files were not validated against ALL markdownlint rules
- Assumption that test files were "perfect" was incomplete

**Resolution:**

1. ‚úÖ Fixed line 3 in perfect-code-blocks.md (shortened to 79 characters)
2. ‚úÖ Added comprehensive MD013 documentation to SKILL.md v1.0.2
3. ‚úÖ Updated pre-generation checklist with line length check
4. ‚úÖ Updated post-generation validation steps
5. ‚úÖ Re-tested all perfect documents - all now pass

**Status:** COMPLETE - All violations resolved

## SKILL.md Updates

### Version 1.0.2 Changes

**Added Rule 4: Line Length (MD013)**

- Complete documentation of 80-character line limit
- When line length matters vs when it's often ignored
- Breaking long lines guidance
- Handling long URLs (reference style, angle brackets)
- Error pattern examples

**Updated Checklists:**

- Pre-generation: Added line length check
- Post-generation: Added line length validation

**Version History:**

- Documented Phase 3 testing completion
