# Phase 6: Packaging & Deployment - Status Check

**Date:** 2025-10-24
**Current Version:** 1.1.1
**Status:** In Progress

## Option C: Comprehensive Status Check

### Current Version Analysis

**Files Reviewed:**

- SKILL.md: Version 1.1.1 ✅
- CHANGELOG.md: Has v1.1.1 entry ✅
- README.md: Version 1.0.2 ⚠️ (NEEDS UPDATE)
- ROADMAP.md: References v1.0.3 ⚠️ (NEEDS UPDATE)
- PHASE_5_COMPLETE.md: References v1.1.0 ⚠️ (OUTDATED)

### Version Discrepancies Found

**Critical Finding:** Version numbers are inconsistent across files.

1. **SKILL.md** = v1.1.1 (CORRECT - source of truth)
2. **CHANGELOG.md** = v1.1.1 (CORRECT - matches SKILL.md)
3. **README.md** = v1.0.2 (OUTDATED - needs update to v1.1.1)
4. **ROADMAP.md** = v1.0.3 (OUTDATED - needs update to v1.1.1)
5. **PHASE_5_COMPLETE.md** = v1.1.0 (OUTDATED - v1.1.1 supersedes)

### What v1.1.1 Contains

Based on CHANGELOG.md entry for v1.1.1 (2025-10-24):

**CRITICAL FIXES:**

- Added Core Principle 4 on invisible characters
- Added Rule 8: Character Encoding and Spacing
- Added Error Pattern 7 for non-breaking space (nbsp) issues
- Added nbsp detection/fix procedures
- Enhanced documentation for AI-generated markdown pitfalls

**Why This Version Matters:**

Addresses invisible character issues (nbsp) that break markdown parsing:

- List numbering restarts unexpectedly
- Code blocks fail to nest in lists
- Confusing validation errors on visually correct markdown

**Impact:** HIGH - Critical for reliable AI markdown generation

### Git Status Unknown

**Cannot determine:**

- Whether v1.1.1 has been committed
- Whether it has been pushed to GitHub
- Current branch state
- Staged vs unstaged files

**Action Required:** User needs to run:

```bash
cd /c/Users/kgend/Projects/md_skill_md
git status
git log --oneline -5
```

### Files That Need Updates for v1.1.1

**Priority 1: Critical Documentation**

1. **README.md** (currently v1.0.2)
   - Update version number to 1.1.1
   - Add v1.1.1 to version history section
   - Mention critical nbsp fix in features
   - Update "Last Updated" date

2. **ROADMAP.md** (currently v1.0.3)
   - Update version history to v1.1.1
   - Update "Current Status" section
   - Update completion metrics
   - Update "Last Updated" date

**Priority 2: Phase Documentation**

3. **PHASE_5_COMPLETE.md**
   - Note: This references v1.1.0, but v1.1.1 supersedes it
   - Consider creating PHASE_5_FINAL.md or updating

4. **PROJECT-STRUCTURE.md** (needs checking)
   - May need version update
   - May need file list update

**Priority 3: Supporting Docs**

5. **USAGE.md** (needs checking)
   - May need nbsp guidance
   - May need version update

6. **INTEGRATION.md** (needs checking)
   - May need nbsp configuration notes
   - May need version update

7. **QUICK_REFERENCE.md** (needs checking)
   - May need nbsp warning
   - May need version update

### What Appears Complete

**Already Correct:**

- ✅ SKILL.md at v1.1.1 with full nbsp documentation
- ✅ CHANGELOG.md has v1.1.1 entry
- ✅ Core skill content is comprehensive
- ✅ Examples directory exists
- ✅ Tests directory exists
- ✅ Resources directory exists

### Phase 6 Recommended Workflow

**Given the uncertainty about git status:**

1. **First: Check Git Status**
   - Run `git status` to see what's staged/committed
   - Run `git log --oneline -10` to see recent commits
   - Determine if v1.1.1 has been committed/pushed

2. **Second: Update Documentation (Priority 1 files)**
   - Update README.md to v1.1.1
   - Update ROADMAP.md to v1.1.1
   - Verify consistency across all docs

3. **Third: Validation & Testing**
   - Run markdownlint on all updated files
   - Verify nbsp fixes are documented
   - Run Phase 3 test suite if possible

4. **Fourth: Git Operations**
   - Stage all updated files
   - Create comprehensive commit message
   - Tag release as v1.1.1 (if not already)
   - Push to GitHub

5. **Fifth: Final Packaging**
   - Create release notes
   - Update installation instructions
   - Verify all cross-references work

## Immediate Next Steps

**User should provide:**

1. Output of `git status`
2. Output of `git log --oneline -5`
3. Confirmation: Has v1.1.1 been committed?
4. Confirmation: Has v1.1.1 been pushed to GitHub?

**Then we can proceed with:**

- Option B: Documentation updates (if not committed)
- Option A: Validation testing (if committed but not validated)
- Git operations (if validated but not pushed)

## Questions for User

1. **Has v1.1.1 been committed locally?**
   - Yes → Proceed with validation
   - No → Update docs, then commit

2. **Has v1.1.1 been pushed to GitHub?**
   - Yes → Phase 6 may be largely complete
   - No → Need to push after validation

3. **Are there uncommitted changes?**
   - Yes → Review and stage them
   - No → Ready for final steps

4. **Do you want to update to v1.1.2 or v1.2.0?**
   - If fixing docs → v1.1.2 (patch)
   - If adding features → v1.2.0 (minor)
   - If staying at v1.1.1 → Just sync docs

## Status Summary

**Current State:**

- ✅ SKILL.md is at v1.1.1 with critical nbsp fixes
- ✅ CHANGELOG.md documents v1.1.1
- ⚠️ README.md needs update (v1.0.2 → v1.1.1)
- ⚠️ ROADMAP.md needs update (v1.0.3 → v1.1.1)
- ❓ Git status unknown (need user to check)
- ❓ Push status unknown (need user to check)

**Recommendation:**

User should run git commands to determine current state, then we can:

1. Update remaining documentation to v1.1.1
2. Validate everything with markdownlint
3. Commit/push if needed
4. Create final release artifacts

**Ready to proceed once git status is confirmed!**
